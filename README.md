[Codingbat](https://codingbat.com/java "Official Site") Help:
CodingBat is a free site of live Java and Python coding problems to build coding skill. Each problem has a problem description and a table showing some sample output for that problem. Type your Java code into the large text area and click the "Go" button to save your code, compile and run. Each time you click Go, the results are shown in the right side of the page. On each problem page, the "prev" and "next" links lead through the sequence of problems in that section. The "chance" link goes to a random unfinished problem in the section.

The problems in each section get harder towards the end of the section. Some of the problems (marked with an "H") have hint text and/or the solution code available. In particular, all of the problems in the "Warmup" sections have solution code available, so that's an easy way to get started.
